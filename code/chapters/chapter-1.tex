\section{The chaos}
Everything begun in the early $16$-th century, mathematicians were being haunted by one simple observation. When the world was demanding change, when the fate was ripened, and was demanding fruits. 
The observation was simple, \emph{how does one solve equations like} $x^2 + 1 = 0$?
Pioneers like cardano, in his famous work was working on the theory of polynomials, and later brought the attention of people to this surprisingly simple yet haunting problem, \emph{"does there exists a number, which when squared, gives negative of unity?"} 
Now, why the question pondered on only \emph{unity} but not some other element is simple.
Mathematicians observed that, if since we solved the mystery for unity, it will automatically imply the solution for all other real elements.Singe they all knew deeply, that if we somehow s
